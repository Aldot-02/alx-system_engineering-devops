let's discuss the issues with this infrastructure:

Single Points of Failure (SPOF): While this infrastructure is more resilient than the previous one, it still has some SPOFs. The load balancer, the web servers (Server 1 and Server 2), and the database can be potential points of failure. If any of these components fail, it could result in service disruption or reduced availability.

Security Issues: The infrastructure lacks certain security measures. There is no mention of a firewall to protect the servers from unauthorized access or potential attacks. Additionally, HTTPS (SSL/TLS) encryption is not mentioned, leaving the website vulnerable to data interception and manipulation.

Lack of Monitoring: There is no monitoring solution mentioned in the infrastructure. Monitoring tools are essential for tracking the health, performance, and availability of servers, services, and resources. The absence of monitoring makes it difficult to identify and respond to potential issues in a timely manner.
